# DeFoggy

The world's first (or maybe second?) Web 3.0 fitness app

## Goals

Do you get brain fog? Me too, probably from not moving while working from home

This app is designed to make you move

You will be presented with workouts to do throughout you day.

Your rewarded with an NFT of your accomplishment to mint and sell and resell.

## Why Web 3.0?

Besides, it's the future of the internet?

Web 3.0 actually offers something useful. **Hype** that will ultimately result in a ton of VC funding for any half-baked project

Need another reason?

Pseudonymity makes sense for this use case.

I want to use an app like this but don't want to login with Google/FB or create a profile

I want a way to track my progress and compete with my friends but I dont want to give any personal information to this platform

Web 3.0 or using a Wallet as an ID makes sense
